### About Me

I'm a Junior at Boston University pursuing a BA in Computer Science. I take pride in my unique balance of technical skills alongside my strong interpersonal skills. I am a passionate, creative, and motivated leader who loves keeping busy and building new relationships. I thrive in collaborative and challenging environments, and I take on each responsibility with the goal of positively impacting others. 

Outside of my academia, I am passionate about piano playing, traveling, reading, and spending time with my friends & family!
